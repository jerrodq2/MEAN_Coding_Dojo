// ********************** DETERMING SESSION TIME TO LIVE **********************
/*
Above, you see this code:
if (req.body.remembered) {
  req.session.cookie.expires = null
} else {
  req.session.cookie.maxAge = 60000
}

Basically, I have checkbox in the html form that asks if they want to be remembered, if they click it, it will be true. If they don't, it will be false. So, I use that to determine how long the session will live with the above code. If it is true, I set the req.session.cookie.expires to null, which it is by default. In which case, they will stay logged in until they log out. However, if they didn't check the checkbox, I set the req.session.cookie property "maxAge" to 60,000. This determines how long the session will persist or live. This is measured in milliseconds, and there are 1,000 milliseconds in one second. So, 60,000 milliseconds is equal to one minute. So, after one minute, this session will be deleted. You can change this to suit you're needs, see the different values of milliseconds to see some of your options

30 min = 1,800,000 ms
1 hour = 3,600,000 ms
1 day = 86,400,000 ms
1 week = 604,800,000 ms
