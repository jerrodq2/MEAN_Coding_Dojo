<!-- This partial demonstrates how you access things from a controller that's using $scope. As you can see below, the major difference is that I don't have to put the controllers name before any variables or functions. I can just reference them directly-->
<div ng-controller='scope_example_controller'>
  <h1>All Users</h1>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>First Name</th><th>Last Name</th><th>Fav Language</th><th>Actions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr ng-repeat='user in users'>
      <td>{{user.first}}</td><td>{{user.last}}</td><td>{{user.fav}}</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <form class="" action="index.html" method="post">
    <input ng-model="name">
  </form>
  <h3>This partial and controller was made to demonstrate the difference between using $scope or not within the controller.</h3>

  <p>How you show a variable with scope: The array 'arr' is: {{arr}}</p>
</div>
